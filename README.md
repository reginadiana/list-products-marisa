<h2>What resources was used:</h2>

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for to build a interface 
- [Mock](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/mocks/) for request informations about the products 
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) for install dependencies 

<h2>How to run this app:</h2>

Clone this project:

```
git clone "https://github.com/Diana-ops/womakerscodeReact/tree/master/web"
```

> It is necessary to have the files of directory **node_modules** (I don't put in here because are many files) :grimacing:

You can to have this dependencies creating a new project with React:

```
$ yarn create react-app <name_directory>
```

So, move **node_modules** to "web/" directory

With the dependencies create, just run application with:

```
$ cd src
$ yarn start
```

Is possible to see the response of local request acessing http://localhost:3000/
